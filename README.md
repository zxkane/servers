# MCP servers

A collection of reference implementations and community-contributed servers for the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP). This repository showcases the versatility and extensibility of MCP, demonstrating how it can be used to give Large Language Models (LLMs) secure, controlled access to tools and data sources.

Each MCP server is implemented with either the [Typescript MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) or [Python MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk).

## 🌟 Featured Servers

- **[Filesystem](src/filesystem)** - Secure file operations with configurable access controls
- **[GitHub](src/github)** - Repository management, file operations, and GitHub API integration
- **[Google Drive](src/gdrive)** - File access and search capabilities for Google Drive
- **[PostgreSQL](src/postgres)** - Read-only database access with schema inspection
- **[Slack](src/slack)** - Channel management and messaging capabilities
- **[Memory](src/memory)** - Knowledge graph-based persistent memory system
- **[Puppeteer](src/puppeteer)** - Browser automation and web scraping
- **[Brave Search](src/brave-search)** - Web and local search using Brave's Search API
- **[Google Maps](src/google-maps)** - Location services, directions, and place details
- **[Fetch](src/fetch)** - Web content fetching and conversion for efficient LLM usage

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Using MCP Servers in this Repository
Typescript-based servers in this repository can be used directly with `npx`. 

For example, this will start the [Memory](src/memory) server:
```sh
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

Python-based servers in this repository can be used directly with [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/) or [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). `uvx` is recommended for ease of use and setup. 

For example, this will start the [Git](src/git) server:
```sh
# With uvx
uvx mcp-server-git

# With pip
pip install mcp-server-git
python -m mcp_server_git
```

### Using an MCP Client
However, running a server on its own isn't very useful, and should instead be configured into an MCP client. For example, here's the Claude Desktop configuration to use the above server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```

Additional examples of using the Claude Desktop as an MCP client might look like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/files"]
    },
    "git": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-git", "--repository", "path/to/git/repo"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    },
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "postgresql://localhost/mydb"]
    }
  }
}
```
