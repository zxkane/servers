# MCP servers

A collection of reference implementations and community-contributed servers for the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP). This repository showcases the versatility and extensibility of MCP, demonstrating how it can be used to give Large Language Models (LLMs) secure, controlled access to tools and data sources.

## 🌟 Featured Servers

- **[Filesystem](src/filesystem)** - Secure file operations with configurable access controls
- **[GitHub](src/github)** - Repository management, file operations, and GitHub API integration
- **[Google Drive](src/gdrive)** - File access and search capabilities for Google Drive
- **[PostgreSQL](src/postgres)** - Read-only database access with schema inspection
- **[Slack](src/slack)** - Channel management and messaging capabilities
- **[Memory](src/memory)** - Knowledge graph-based persistent memory system
- **[Puppeteer](src/puppeteer)** - Browser automation and web scraping
- **[Brave Search](src/brave-search)** - Web and local search using Brave's Search API
- **[Google Maps](src/google-maps)** - Location services, directions, and place details
- **[Fetch](src/fetch)** - Web content fetching and conversion for efficient LLM usage

## 🚀 Getting Started

The servers in this repository can be used directly with `npx`. For example:

```sh
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

This will start the [Memory](src/memory) server. However, this isn't very useful on its own, and should instead be configured into an MCP client. For example, here's the Claude Desktop configuration to use the above server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```

Additional examples might look like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/files"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    },
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "postgresql://localhost/mydb"]
    }
  }
}
```
